# Entropy for time series

Codes to compute a recurrence plot (RP) (see http://www.recurrence-plot.tk/) and the entropy quantifier based on microstates in a RP (https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5042026).
In the script Entropy_LogisticMap.py I test this entropy quantifier on the Logistic map.

The code has been used for our study on detection of (regional) dynamical transitions in spatiotemporal climate fields.

The code has been updated following the paper https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5125921
The new entropy quantifier proposed is defined as the maximum entropy computable from a RP. It shows extremely
well correlation witht he maximum Lyapunov exponent of the time series. A big plus: it is parameter free.
This page will be updated soon with the new code. If needed, contact Fabrizio Falasca at fabrifalasca@gmail.com


Note: In a moment of crazyness I added a license to this code. If this is against someone's religion, please le me know.
