# Entropy for time series

Code to compute the entropy of a time series based on the maximum entropy principle as proposed by Prado et al. (2019) in https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5125921 

In test.ipynb we show how to use the code in the context of Logistic map.

In parallel.py we give a parallelized version of the code (using https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This is to be preferred if dealing with spatiotemporal datasets.

An application of this kind of entropy quantifiers can be found here:
