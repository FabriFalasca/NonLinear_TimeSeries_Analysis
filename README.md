# NonLinear_TimeSeries_Analysis

Codes to compute a recurrence plot (RP) (see http://www.recurrence-plot.tk/) and the entropy quantifier based on microstates in a RP (https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5042026).
In the script Entropy_LogisticMap.py I test this entropy quantifier on the Logistic map.

The code has been used for our study on detection of (regional) dynamical transitions in spatiotemporal climate fields.
