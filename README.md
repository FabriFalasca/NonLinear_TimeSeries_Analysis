# NonLinear_TimeSeries_Analysis

Codes to compute a recurrence plot (RP) (http://www.recurrence-plot.tk/) and the entropy quantification based on microstates in a RP (https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5042026).
Then a simple script (Entropy_LogisticMap.py) to test this entropy quantifier on the Logistic map.

The code has been used for the paper: 
Spatiotemporal complexity and time-dependent climate networks in the past 6,000 years
