# NonLinear_TimeSeries_Analysis

### NOTE: Under construction...

In the folder "RecurrenceEntropy" you will find codes for computing the entropy of all time series in a spatio-temporal field.
The entropy of time series is a proxy for complexity and can quantify non linear shifts (as opposed to simple linear measures 
such as averages, variance, Fourier Spectra etc.).
The method used for entropy quantification can be found here https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5042026.
The authors proposed a new complexity quantifier based on the information entropy of occurrences of microstates in a 
recurrence plot.
